            <Link href="https://up.com.au">Up</Link>: The best bank in
            Australia! I currently do lots of different computery things that
            help and hinder the development of Up, a pretty popular online bank
            in Australia.

                probably won't be active at the time you're checking it out. At
                Up, we randomly gave people a chance to win back their morning
                coffee. The web experience was a live map that showed where
                people were winning, jumping all across Australia and zooming in
                on the cafes.

            : Formely known as Bullclip, it's a platform for live collaboration
            on PDFs. I spent a year and a half working mostly on the web
            platform. Pretty proud of the work that I did there - we solved some
            cool problems.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span className="font-bold"> JavaScript everywhere! </span>: I
                shoehorned React Native into an existing iOS application so I
                could contribute some feature development without knowing Swift.
                And it shipped! It was deleted 6 months down the track, but I
                got it out the door. I even gave a talk at the melbourne React
                meetup about it.

            : A web share trading platform - I was a fresh grad, and it was a
            pretty massive project before I arrived. Maybe if you've picked an
            account/portfolio, you've used my code.

              One word smackdown:

            How fast can you type the word on the screen? Pretty sure this came
            about after my partner claimed I wasn't a good typist. Obviously the
            only way to disprove this outrageous accusation was to build
            adequate software first.

            I never finished this, but the idea was multi-track looping in the
            browser. It's super jank, but I remember it being somewhat novel and
            functional. Probably fun for like 2 minutes.
