Iâ€™ve been plagued by this annoying issue for a long time.

Youâ€™re all ready to hack the world and get something productive done. Full of excitement, trepidation, and maybe lethal quantities of caffeine â€” you hit the start button, type `powers` (because power alone might open powerpoint) and clearly you have more than one power. Then you hit Enter.

**What you expect**: a powershell window opens, full frontal, and all your emotional, marital, and chiropractic problems are solved.

**What happens**: The powershell icon appears on the taskbar, but even clicking it does nothing. You try everything â€” nothing seems to bring the damn window into focus.

**How to fix:**

1. Hover over the icon until you see the window itself, only ant-sized.
2. Right click this window, and hit properties.

3. Now, you should see this dialog:

4. Switch to the layout tab, and tick the box that says â€˜Let system position windowâ€™. Hit â€˜OKâ€™.

Now, I canâ€™t quite remember whether you have to restart powershell or whether it works straight away. But if you donâ€™t see your powershell window now or after clicking it in the taskbar â€” just kill it and open powershell again.

I canâ€™t remember where I read this piece of wisdom, but it was along the lines of â€” if something takes you more than 2 minutes to type/explain, write a post and put it online. Iâ€™m going to start following this from now on. ðŸŽ‰
