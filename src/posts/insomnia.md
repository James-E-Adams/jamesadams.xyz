I wasn't getting tired so I sat down to try and write something. But the words never came.

So I picked up the guitar instead and recorded a bit of _The Rain Song_ by _Led Zeppelin_.

I first heard this song when I was 13 or 14, and the original recording still sends shivers down my spine. I'm glad it didn't get stigmatised in the same way _Stairway to Heaven_ did.

Anyway, please enjoy!
